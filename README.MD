### Welcome to my - n5 Test ðŸš€

This is my personal test for n5, I hope you will like it. In the following concepts we will say what we use to optimize the applications :)

## Technologies

- Micro-frontends
- Concurrently
- RectJs
- Styled Components
- Babel
- Webpacks 5

## How run the app

In this section try to optimize it as much as possible, leaving us only having to run a single command for it :)

```js
npm run install-all
```

Run the app when you already installed all the packpages

```js
npm run only-run
```
